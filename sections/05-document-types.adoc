== Document types

All documents must have at least one document type, or category. A
document may appear in more than one category, if appropriate.

=== Directive

Internal, normative documents approved by the CalConnect Board of Directors,
developed by TC PUBLISH, that provides requirements for
internal CalConnect processes.


=== Standard

Normative documents created through the CalConnect standardization process
that provide requirements, specifications or guidelines for the public.

Requirements in standards shall be based on objective performance
rather than based on descriptive characteristics.


=== Guide

Informative, internal documents that describe guidelines for the work of
CalConnect technical committees.

Often a document discussing problems or issues and making suggestions for
action.


=== Specification

Informative specifications for the public.

It could be an experimental specification intended for research and exploration,
such as to encourage trial implementations, to determine its usefulness and
applicability.

A published Specification deemed successful would be candidates for progression
towards a Standard.


=== Amendment

Normative documents that amend a published CalConnect document, such as a
Standard.


=== Technical corrigendum

Document that describes a minor amendment of a published CalConnect
document, that does not affect the overall validity of the original
document.

Could be a normative or informative document for public or
internal consumption.


=== Reports

Informative document, reporting on an event or presenting findings
of a study or research effort, which may reach conclusions but does
not contain suggestions for action, except incidentally.

Intended for internal or public consumption.

[example]
A report on a CalConnect conference.


=== Administrative

A document type for meeting minutes, proposals to committees, policy
documents, and other material, generally of an internal nature.
