== Introduction

CalConnect is committed in expanding the realm of open
collaboration standards across the globe and across communities of
practice.

To facilitate its mission, the CalConnect Board of Directors has decided
to align standardization and publication processes with international
best practices, such as the ISO standardization process, and the
<<WTOTBTP>>.
This document aims to achieve the said intention.

The document describes the CalConnect standardization process, from
conception, IPR policy, TC establishment, collaboration policies
(liaisons), to the publishing of work items.

Processes described in this document contain parts that relate
to all CalConnect technical committees and the TCC, which
carries responsibility of implementing these processes.
