== Standardization process

=== General

Every CalConnect deliverable starts as a project.

A CalConnect project goes through the following processes:

* starts with a proposal;
* the proposal is given to the approving entity for enactment;
* assigns a committee as project owner once the project is approved;
* the committee creates one or more working drafts from the proposal;
* the committee decides to endorse a committee draft;
* the approved committee draft becomes a standards draft
* the draft standard is given to the approving entity for endorsement;
* the draft standard is approved for publication as a standard.

//NOTE: TODO: joint publishing

=== Project stages

The following table provides a mapping between CalConnect project stages and
ISO project stages. This document identifies stages
according to the CalConnect project stage names.

=== Project track

There is only one project track in CalConnect as considered by the TCC.


==== Co-development guidelines

For projects under co-development agreements, CalConnect agrees to
adopt a developmental track not slower than a corresponding track
selected by the external standardization body to ensure
synchronicity between development outcome and publication.



=== Project ownership

==== General

All CalConnect non-administrative documents must be owned by a single
Technical Committee (the "`owning`" Technical Committee) even if two
or more TCs participate in the work of developing the document.


==== Transition of ownership on TC retirement

When a TC completes its scope of work and is shut down, the ownership
of its documents moves to the TCC.

TCC may retain ownership of a document once assigned to it, or
it may assign the document to a different or new Technical Committee,
generally if follow-on work or maintenance is required on the document.


=== Project membership

==== General

The owning TC is responsible for maintaining expert membership of a
project group.

CalConnect members are allowed to nominate experts to the project group
with approval of the owning TC.

At least one person, at most two, serves as project leader, as decided
by the owning TC.

The project leader(s) shall assume project editorship unless that
activity is specifically assigned to another individual.


==== External members

Individuals who are not members of CalConnect are only allowed to participate in
a project unless specifically authorized by the project owning TC, in consultation
with the project leader, and approved by the TCC.


==== Co-development guidelines

Parties may bring in additional collaborators given approval by the
corresponding JCG, that the provisions of this agreement
are fully satisfied by agreements present between all collaborators.



=== Project stages


==== Preliminary stage

===== Initiation methods

A standardization project can be initiated in one of the following ways:

. a project defined as part of the charter process of a TC;

. a TC decides to create a new project as an addition to its program of work;

. the TCC or the Board of Directors decides that a project should
be initiated and assigns it to a Technical Committee.


===== Initiation requirements

When a project is initiated, the following items must be defined
by the proposer as part of the proposal to the TCC:

. scope

. target audience

. schedule for development and publication

. proposer, project leader

All documents other than administrative documents must have an editor
or editors who are members of the Technical Committee(s) developing the
document.


===== Confirmation

Once a project is confirmed initiation:

* the project shall be assigned a project number as decided by the TCC; and

* the project's name and stage shall be listed in the project registry.

NOTE: This document supports the creation of a project registry.


===== First draft

A first draft of the standardization deliverable may be created
for proposal submission, or may be created in the Committee stage.

Disclaimers and necessary statements such as relating to IPR and
copyright shall be placed in an obvious place in the draft.


===== Co-development guidelines

The draft shall be created through a collaboration process between
experts from both organizations, or at least, the proposing
organization should have received input from the other organization.

At the first instance where a CalConnect project wishes to co-develop
with an external standardization body, it should be raised to the TCC.
The JCG shall consult the stakeholders to determine appropriateness
of the project and advise the proposer.

If the project is rejected by the TCC, its output may still be
developed within CalConnect if it is appropriate, and its output may
still be proposed to the TCC for co-development in later stages.



==== Proposal stage

When the TCC determines interest within CalConnect to develop the
proposed project, the project initiator should submit a proposal
to the TCC for ballot indicating its wish to develop the proposed project.

If accepted, the project shall be adopted by a CalConnect TC.
Members of the project group shall be represented by experts.
This project shall then be listed in the TCC register of projects.

If rejected, its output may still be developed by one or more members
of CalConnect if appropriate, and the resulting output may still be
proposed to the TCC for development in later stages.


A "`Report`" document type shall be published upon a successful ballot
of two-thirds approval at this stage.


===== Co-development guidelines

The TCC should also consider JCGs whether a proposal is suitable
to be co-developed with existing liaison organizations or
external standardization bodies.

The TCC may suggest the project group to co-develop the project
under one or more JCGs.


==== Preparatory stage

This is an optional stage.

The goal of the preparatory stage is to create a "`working draft`"
of the deliverable approved by the project group within the TC.

Once the project team decides the working draft has advanced
to being a "`committee draft`" or a "`draft standard`", this
stage ends.

There is no ballot at this stage.


==== Committee stage

This is an optional stage.

The goal of the committee stage is to create a "`committee draft`"
of the deliverable approved by the TC.

The owning TC distributes the committee draft and may select a 8-week or 10-week
comment period for TC members to comment.

Within 4 weeks of completion of the comment period, the owning TC shall distribute
all formal comments received during ballot to TC members.

Given the results of comments, the Chair of the TC, considering TC consensus,
in consultation with the project leader (if necessary),
shall decide on the below outcomes:

. to prepare and circulate a revised committee draft for consideration; or

. to register the committee draft for the enquiry stage.

In case TC consensus is unclear from the results, a ballot (<<process-balloting>>) can be launched
to determine consensus for stage advancement.

A "`Specification`" document type shall be published upon advancement
to the enquiry stage.


[[stage-enquiry]]
==== Enquiry stage

The goal of the enquiry stage is to create a "`draft standard`"
of the deliverable approved by the TC.

The public review period (<<public-review>>) shall be started within
4 weeks of entering this stage.

Once the owning TC deems a document under development to be
ready for publication, the Chair of the owning TC shall arrange
for an official ballot (<<process-balloting>>) amongst TC members.
"`No`" votes must be accompanied with technical reasons.

If no "`No`" votes were registered in the DIS ballot,
the project is deemed to have unanimous support. It shall be fast-tracked
towards the Approval stage for TCC ballot.

If the ballot was successful but at least one "`No`" vote has been received,
the project is advanced to Approval stage.

If the ballot failed, the Chair of the owning TC, in consultation
with the project leader to decide whether to prepare and circulate a revised
draft standard for re-balloting.


===== Co-development guidelines

In these stages, members of the project groups within CalConnect
and the external standardization body shall collaborate closely
to ensure efficient and effective development of the deliverable of
the respective stages. The deliverable shall be developed
jointly by experts of the collaborating organizations.

The project stages of the collaborating organizations shall
be synchronized correspondingly.

Specifically:

* If a deliverable is approved by ballot at an ISO TC,
  CalConnect will advance the project stage at its
  project group accordingly.
* If a deliverable is rejected by ballot at an ISO TC,
  CalConnect will not advance project stage at its
  project group, unless the ISO TC re-ballot approves
  advancement of the deliverable.
* In cases where a development stage is optional and skipped
  in accordance with <<ISODIR1>> and <<ISODIR1C>>, CalConnect
  shall set the stage of its project at the corresponding
  stage.


[[stage-approval]]
==== Approval stage

The goal of the approval stage is to create a "`final draft standard`"
of the deliverable approved by the CalConnect membership.

The public review period (<<public-review>>) shall be started within
4 weeks of entering this stage, unless the document has already
been reviewed publicly at the Enquiry stage (<<stage-enquiry>>).

A "`last call`" for formal comments shall be issued by the Chair of
the owning TC to both TCC and to the full CalConnect mailing list
of 8 weeks.

The formal commenting process is described in detail at <<comments-formal>>.

After the close of the commenting period, the Chair of TCC shall
distribute the comments to the CalConnect membership within
4 weeks of the close, and conduct a 8-week ballot (<<process-balloting>>)
of TCC members for a vote to approve publication.

All TCC members are required to vote in this ballot. A TCC member
that did not vote in the TCC poll is considered to have violated
membership terms of the TCC, and has a 3-week period to rectify.

"`No`" votes from a TCC member must be accompanied with constructive
comments.

If the ballot was successful, the project is deemed to be ready for
publication and is advanced to the publication stage.

If the ballot failed, the Chair of the owning TC, in consultation
with the project leader to decide whether to prepare and circulate a revised
final draft standard for re-balloting.


[[draft-stages]]
==== Draft development stages (Preparatory, Committee and Enquiry stages)

. Each new draft version of the document as it is developed shall be
posted by the editor(s) on the CalConnect Document Repository. A
version is defined as a checkpoint where the developers want review
from individuals other than active contributors, typically at the
end of a development stage when the draft is a candidate for ballot.

. The availability of each new draft version shall be announced
to all contributing TCs.

. A draft version may be announced to the `calconnect-l` mailing
list if CalConnect-wide membership comment is requested.

. A draft version may be posted for external review and
comments upon approval by TCC (see <<public-review>>).
This is normally be done at the Enquiry and Approval stages,
where the draft is considered more mature for appropriate
external input.

. Once initial approval is given by TCC, a draft may be posted
for external review and comment multiple times.

In every of the development stages, resolution of all outstanding
comments is required to proceed towards ballot.


[[pre-publication]]
==== Pre-publication stages (Enquiry and Approval stages)

Once a "`draft standard`" or a "`final draft standard`" is approved
towards publication, a public review period ensues.

The public review process is described in <<public-review>>.



==== Publication stage

// TODO:

===== Distribution

Once TCC approves a document for publication, the Chair of the
owning TC shall forward the final draft standard to the
Executive Director of the Consortium for publication.

Internal documents are made available only to members of CalConnect
via the members area of the CalConnect website, and are registered in
the CalConnect Internal Document Register.

===== Statement changes

The "`boilerplate`" statements of IP, appropriate usage and
disclaimer will be changed to the external (public) statement.


===== Registration at the public document register

The name, category, version and project number of the deliverable
shall be registered in the CalConnect Public Document Register.



=== Abandonment

==== Co-development guidelines

A joint work item may be abandoned by one of the two parties if it sees
it being inappropriate or is no longer interested or able to contribute
to the joint work item. Each party is allowed to abandon the joint
work, which at that point will become sole work of the other party.

A notice of such must be sent by the abandoning party to the JCG and
distributed by both parties to its members.

The abandoning party, if the abandoned work is carried on by the other
party, is required to explicitly agree that the copyright of such work
is to be waived to the other party to allow publication of the document.

If the abandons party wishes to rejoin an abandoned work item, it is
agreed in this agreement that it is allowed, given a notice is filed at
the JCG, unless in exceptional circumstances.




[[process-balloting]]
=== Balloting

A ballot is launched upon gauging consensus within a group
(TC, TCC or amongst all members).

In each ballot, a member is allocated three options:

* Yes
* No
* Abstain

A "`No`" vote must be accompanied by constructive comments. "`Abstain`" votes
are not counted against the outcome.

Consensus is considered to have been reached when there are two-thirds of "`Yes`" votes.




=== Notification

Notification of availability of new documents within CalConnect
will be announced to the appropriate {collaborative-iso-tc} working groups
and CalConnect technical committees.

=== Availability of working documents

Drafts and working documents are available according to
each party's normal practices.


=== Distribution of publication

After an ISO ballot on the acceptance of a joint work item as
DIS, FDIS or IS, the joint work item will be published
as a CalConnect Standard.


=== Promotional activities in co-developed projects

Promotional programs will be shared between {collaborative-iso-tc}
and CalConnect for the purpose of coordinating marketing activities
via the JCG.



=== External progression

In some cases, CalConnect deliverables are sent to be progressed
at another standards body:

* upon completion of the Approval stage, a CalConnect document may be sent
  immediately to an external standardization body for progression
  to become a standard; and

* if a published CalConnect document is subsequently decided to
  be forwarded to another standards body for progression.

In these situations, the CalConnect document shall be accompanied by a
link at the CalConnect website, that provides the document at the target standards
body, completely with document number, title, etc. given by that
standards body.

It is anticipated that such documents will be progressed and modified
according to the processes of the recipient standards body. CalConnect
shall attempt to ensure that the link remains valid, and if
possible for the most current version of the document.


=== Document requirements

Requirements of a CalConnect document are stated in <<CC10002>>.
