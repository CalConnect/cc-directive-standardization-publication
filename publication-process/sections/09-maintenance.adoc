== Maintenance of deliverables

=== Review period

The review period of a standardization deliverable is 5 years.

The review shall be performed by the owning TC, if it has been
disbanded, the TCC.

=== Updates

When a document is deemed to be updated, the owning TC shall
take action to either begin the review period in order to
update the document, or begin a new project to produce an amendment.

When a document is revised, any changes (as opposed to editorial
corrections) should result in the document going through the same
review process originally used for its publication.


(TODO: do we need this?)
A change log shall be provided as an appendix to all documents
following their initial publication. The change log will document each
new update and the changes made to the document.


=== New versions

A document once published may undergo revision and become a new
version or dot release (i.e. V1-V2 or V2.0-V2.1) under several
circumstances.


=== Withdrawal

When a review determines that a published item should be
withdrawn, it should be withdrawn from the list of published
standards.
