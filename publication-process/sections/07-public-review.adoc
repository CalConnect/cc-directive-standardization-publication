== Public review process


=== General

A public review period of 60 days is required for compliance to
<<WTOTBT>> rules, which CalConnect adheres to.


=== Timing

A 60-day public review shall be held in the DIS or FDIS stages
of the standardization deliverable.

Under co-development, the public review shall be held on
the first instance of reaching the DIS stage:

* Comments to CalConnect shall be performed through CalConnect's public review procedure.
* Comments to an ISO TC shall be performed according to <<ISODIR1>> and <<ISODIR1C>>.
* Comments to an external standardization body shall be according to their own procedures.

The co-development parties shall agree to synchronization of the dates
of review periods for the maximum benefit to the joint work item.

////
Public draft period will be an open one at CalConnect, it will be at
the stage of pre-publication.

=== Informal comments via public review mailing list

Informal comments can be solicited from and posted to the
CalConnect public review mailing list.

This list is open to subscription by any interested parties,
but subscription will be subject to approval by the list
moderator and the list will be continuously moderated.

The Charter and Rules of Use for the list include:

. It is the responsibility of all participants on the list to ensure
that their comments adhere to the CalConnect Intellectual Property
Rights policy with respect to contributions.

. While all participants on this list are free to contribute
suggestions and comments, the actual process of development and
revision of any CalConnect Document must be made by the Technical
Committees developing the document, and by members of the Consortium.

Participants on the public review mailing list may offer comments not
only upon documents currently posted for review and comment, but upon
published documents of the Consortium.

The TCC committee has overall control of the public review list
and process including what documents may be posted, the duration of
postings, etc.

For details of handling informal comments, see <<comments-informal>>.


=== Formal comments via dedicated site

Formal comments have to be submitted via the CalConnect commenting site.

In a public review process where formal comments are received:

* the full list of formal comments are only viewable by CalConnect
members;

* formal comments from non-CalConnect members should be addressed
and communicated to the commenter individually.

For details of handling formal comments, see <<comments-formal>>.



[[announcement-channels]]
=== Announcement channels

When a draft document is made available for public review, it shall be
announced:

* on the public review page and on the CalConnect home page;
* on the public review mailing list; and
* on the general `calconnect` mailing list.


==== Eligibility

. At the request of the Chair of the owning TC and
upon approval of TCC, any draft intended for
publication is eligible for posting to the <<announcement-channels>>.

. A document or section of a document may be posted for public review
and comment at any point within its development but generally it should
be well-formed and close to final draft before such posting.

. If a section of a larger document is posted to the public review
list, the context of the section must be made clear so that relevant
comments can be made.

. When a document previously posted for public review is finally
published, a notification of the fact will be posted to the public
review list along with any title changes.


==== TC responsibilities

. Since posting a document for public review and comment invites non-
Consortium individuals to participate, the owning TC is responsible
for monitoring comments on the public review list and acting upon
them as appropriate.

. Since any participant on the public review list may comment upon any
published document at any time, the list moderator will monitor the
list for comments on such documents and bring those comments to the
attention of TCC.
